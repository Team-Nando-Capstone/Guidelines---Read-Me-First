# Guidelines - Read Me First!

Welcome! 

In this GitHub organisation, you can:
1. create new repositories (repos) for your Capstone project, and
2. access previous repos from other Capstone projects.

***
**NB.** By default, you have *read-only access* to all repos created by others and *write access* to all repos created by you. If you need *write access* to a particular repo not created by you, please contact the creator / admin (Michael/Nando). 
***

Please follow the guidelines below when creating new repositories for your Capstone group.

* Add prefix 'NOxx-', where xx is the number for your group, for all repositories.
* Use meaningful and concise names for your repositories. 
* Set repository visibility to 'private'.
* Give **write access** to your teammates / others, where applicable.
